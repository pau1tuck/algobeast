/* KTH ORDER STATISTICS */
/*
This problem is often referred to as the "Kth Order Statistics" in computer science.
A common method to solve it is the "Quickselect" algorithm, which is a selection algorithm to find the kth smallest (or largest) element in an unordered list.
This problem requires finding the element in the array that would be at position 'k' if the array was sorted, without actually sorting the entire array.
