/* Instructions: Implement Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the shortest path from a single source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.
Input: A graph represented as an adjacency list graph, where graph[u] = [[v, weight], ...] describes edges from node u to node v with a given weight + an integer src representing the source node.
Output: An array of integers, where the i-th element is the minimum distance from the source node to node i. If a node is unreachable, the distance should be represented as Infinity. */
