/* The A* (pronounced "A-star") algorithm is a search and pathfinding algorithm used widely in computer science, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence, for navigating paths between nodes in a graph. It's especially popular in video games and robotics for finding the shortest route from a start node to a target node.

How A* Works:
A* combines features of Dijkstra's algorithm and heuristic-based searching (often using something like the Best-First Search algorithm). It uses a heuristic to estimate the cost from a current node to the goal, guiding the search direction for more efficiency than Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, which strictly considers the actual shortest path found so far without estimation.

Components of A*:
f(n): Total cost of the node n.
g(n): The cost from the start node to n.
h(n): The heuristic estimated cost from node n to the goal. This needs to be admissible, meaning it should not overestimate the actual cost to reach the goal. */

/* Instructions: Implement the A* algorithm to find the shortest path from a start point to an end point on a grid. Consider some cells of the grid as obstacles.
Input: A 2D grid where each cell has a value:
    0 indicates an open cell where movement is allowed.
    1 indicates an obstacle that cannot be crossed.
    A start coordinate as a tuple (startX, startY).
    An end coordinate as a tuple (endX, endY).
Output: An array of coordinates representing the path from the start to the end (inclusive). Return an empty array if no path exists. */

/* Explanation:
PriorityQueue: This class is used to keep the nodes to explore, prioritized by their estimated cost to reach the end.
Heuristic Function: This uses the Manhattan distance, suitable for grid-based maps where diagonal movement is not allowed, or costs more than straight movement.

A Core Logic:* Manages nodes to explore (open list), tracks the best path to each node (cameFrom), and the cost associated with each path (costSoFar).

The provided code is structured to work with a grid, handling obstacles, and can be tested with different start and end points to see how A* efficiently finds a path, if available. */
